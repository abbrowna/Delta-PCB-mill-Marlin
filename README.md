This particular marlin configuration is for a PCB milling machine with a delta kinematic system just like the delta style 3D printers. It is configured to run on a NUCLEO - 64 board, in particular, the Nucleo-F103RB with a custom CNC shield and hence the pinnout is very specific to the particular machine. A new board and pins defenition file was created for it.  The repo also includes some files to use platorm-io on vs-code to build and upload to the Nucleo board.

Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
